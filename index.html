									</a></h2>
									<p>In this group project, we aim to propose an Expense Prediction System for Singapore tourists based on several criteria like 
										the length of stay, hotel preferences, number of companions, travel mode, shopping expenses, and so on, for those who wish to
										 visit Singapore. With the use of machine learning models in the domain of tourism, algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayesian, 
										 Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVR, are used to predict tourist expenses. 
										The dataset contains 8887 rows and 48 columns, based on records from 2014-2015 of Indonesian tourists who visited Singapore.</p>

									<p>The Iris flower identifier project is a machine learning project that aims to classify iris flowers based on 
										their physical characteristics. The iris dataset, which is widely used in machine learning, contains
										 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
										 Each sample is labeled with one of three species of iris: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

										The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to accurately identify the species
										 of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics. This can be done using various algorithms such 
										 as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, or support vector machines.</p>

									<p>The movie recommendation system project using cosine similarity method in ML would require a
										 good understanding of machine learning techniques and data preprocessing methods.
										 
										 Content-based methods are
										  based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one
										   movie, similar movies are recommended. For example, if a user watches a comedy movie starring Adam Sandler, 
										   the system will recommend them movies in the same genre or starring the same actor, or both. With this in 
										   mind, the input for 
										 building a content-based recommender system is movie attributes.</p>

										It is a subfield of artificial intelligence which tells machines how to manipulate data more proficiently. 
										The three stages of Machine Learning are taking some data as input, extracting features, and predicting new
